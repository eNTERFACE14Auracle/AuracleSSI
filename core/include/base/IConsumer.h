/**
 * \brief Interface for a service that consumes information. 
 *
 * A Consumer opens the system to the outside world. SSI contains generic consumers for 
 * storing information to disk, visualize it in a graph, or sending it to an external 
 * application through a socket connection. Consumers can also serve as classifiers, which
 * map continuous observations to discrete categories. Because a consumer reads information 
 * from one or more buffer without writing information back to the system, it is not 
 * restricted to work with a constant sample rate (see Trigger).
