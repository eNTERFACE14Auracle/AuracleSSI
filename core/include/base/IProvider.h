/**
 * \brief Interface for a service that provides information. 
 *
 * A provider feeds information into the system. In fact, any source of information 
 * that generates output at a constant sample rate can be connected. In practise 
 * this would usally be a sensor device, such as a microphone or a video camera.
 *
 * Before a Provider can be used to stream data init() must be called once to 
 * tell SSI what kind of data will be provided. Whenever now data is available 
 * the input device can now call provide() to share it with connected entities.
