/**
 * \brief Interface for a service that manipulates information. 
 *
 * A transformer constantly reads information from one or more buffer, transforms it, 
 * and writes the result back to another buffer. As long as output is produced 
 * with a constant sample rate, its format may differ from the input in sample dimension, 
 * sample rate and sample bytes.
 *
 * In SSI each Transfromer runs in its own thread. Just before the thread is created
 * transform_enter is called. This gives the possibility to complete necessary initialization 
 * steps. Yet, no processing takes place here.
 *
 * Once transform_enter has been passed the thread is created and transform is 
 * constantly called when data is available. The incoming data is passed in the
 * stream_in variable. Since it contains a deep copy of the input buffer changes
 * to the data stream_in points at are possible. However you are not supposed to apply
 * changes to the pointer or the size of the data, nor to any of ther other fields, such as 
 * dimension or sample rate. Note that these values are fixed throughout the whole
 * run. The final output of the transformation is stored in stream_out. The required
 * memory is pre-allocated. Again, you are not supposed to change any other field.
 *
 * When the thread is stopped transform_flush is called. This gives you the chance
 * to clean up temporary memory. Again, no processing takes place here.
